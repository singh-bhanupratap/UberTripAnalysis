# Uber Trip Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Uber trip data for June 2024 across various parts of New York City, using interactive Power BI dashboards. The analysis is based on two datasets:

1.) Uber Trip Details (individual ride records)

2.) Location Table (corresponding location information)


The analysis is presented through two main dashboards and a supporting data tab:

1. Overview Analysis Dashboard:
This dashboard provides a high-level summary of total bookings, total trip distance, and total booking value, and their breakdown by metrics like payment type, and vehicle type, along with location based analyses.

Insights:

(i) Uber Pay was used for 67% of all trips, making it the dominant method. Amazon Pay held 32%, suggesting Amazonâ€™s growing role in digital payments. Cash is nearly obsolete.

(ii) Daytime dominates usage (68%), but a substantial number of rides still happen at night (32%), indicating around-the-clock demand.

(iii) UberX dominates both in bookings (38.7k) and trip distance (131.5k miles). Other vehicle types have balanced usage, suggesting diversified customer needs.

(iv) Penn Station / Madison Sq West is the busiest pickup point, while Upper East Side North is the most frequent drop-off location.


2. Time Analysis Dashboard:
This dashboard explores trends over time, including booking patterns by pick up time of day, and day of the week.

Insights:
